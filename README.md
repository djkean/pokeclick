berry clicker idea(s)

- make my own browser based "clicker" game inspired by cookie clicker and pokemon

- concept started as an inside joke among friends ~5-6 years ago

- clicker/incremental game that is shorter the more you interact with the game, but can still be progressed just by having it open and being inactive

- progress on the game means buying more ways to automate the game

- local saving (option to import/export a save)

- chrome based browsers "pause" a tab thats not active,
so if possible id like to make the game recognize how long its been inactive for and compensate in terms of how much progress that wouldve been 

- a lot of these games are prone to suffering memory leak
id like to avoid or lessen memory leak if possible

- you would "shake" a tree and berries would fall out, and could upgrade:
time before you could shake the tree again
amount of berries per action
increase the likelihood of rarer berries

- you would start off with 1 tree "A", implying you have the ability to get different versions of trees with different berries
these berries are used as currency for upgrades

- first upgrade would just be generic automation, bought with mainly the most common berry from the 1st tree

- rare chance of an "event" happening, similar concept to golden cookies from cookie clicker
instead of a singular event, maybe roll every second for whether an event will happen or not, then roll for which one or something
